 Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!
 
 The OpenBSD project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like
-operating system. Our efforts emphasize portability, standardization,
 correctness, proactive security and integrated cryptography. As an example of
 the effect OpenBSD has, the popular OpenSSH software comes from OpenBSD.

 OpenBSD is freely available from our download sites.
 
 The current release is OpenBSD 6.2, released Oct 9, 2017.
 
-OpenBSD is developed entirely by volunteers. The project's development
 environment and developer events are funded through contributions collected by
-The OpenBSD Foundation. Contributions ensure that OpenBSD will remain a vibrant
 and free operating system. 
 
 
 Obviously, each developer working on OpenBSD has their own aims and priorities,

 Integrate good code from any source with acceptable licenses. ISC or Berkeley
-style licences are preferred, the GPL is not acceptable when adding new code,
 NDAs are never acceptable. We want to make available source code that anyone
-can use for ANY PURPOSE, with no restrictions. We strive to make our software
-robust and secure, and encourage companies to use whichever pieces they want
-to. There are commercial spin-offs of OpenBSD.
